// Wait a minuteâ€”what's a port? To understand ports, 
// let's make an analogy. Imagine that a website is like a college campus. A website has an address, 
// referred to as the host. A college campus also has an address. The host tells the client where to go, 
// but it doesn't specify exactly where to go. Likewise, if you have the address for a college campus, you don't 
// know exactly which building or classroom to go to. The port is like a building/classroom; it gives the exact desination on the host.

// The host for a website is the domain name, like google.com. The port is the number that comes after the domain name, like google.com:80.
// The port number is the way that a computer knows which program on the host to send the request to.
